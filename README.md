# Simple Java Mail #

Simple Java Mail aims to be the simplest to use lightweight mailing framework for Java, while being able to send complex emails including attachments and embedded images. Just send your emails without dealing with RFC's.

The Simple Java Mail framework essentially is a wrapper around the JavaMail smtp mailing API that allows users to define emails on a high abstraction level without having to deal with mumbo jumbo such a 'multipart' and 'mimemessage'.
